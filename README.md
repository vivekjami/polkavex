## Project Overview

Polkavex extends 1inch Fusion+ to enable secure, bidirectional token swaps between Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems. Unlike traditional bridges, it leverages Polkadot's parachain composability to intelligently route swaps through optimal parachains (Acala for yields, Moonbeam for speed) using AI-powered decision making.

This is an early-stage MVP built for ETHGlobal Unite DeFi hackathon. I'm developing solo, learning as I build, and focusing on genuine utility over hype. The goal is simple: make cross-chain swaps actually work well for users.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Day 6 Complete** - System validated and submission-ready! All components tested, demo prepared, comprehensive documentation complete. 100% success rate across full-system tests.

## User Story

**Sarah**, a DeFi trader, holds 1,000 USDC on Ethereum but wants to earn 8% APY on Acala's liquid staking. Today, she faces:
- Multiple bridge transactions with high fees
- Manual parachain selection
- No visibility into optimal routing
- Risk of failed cross-chain transactions

**With Polkavex**: Sarah initiates one swap. The system automatically routes her USDC through Acala for maximum yield, handles all cross-chain complexity, and provides real-time status updates. One transaction, optimal outcome.

### Core Components

**Smart Contracts**
- **Ethereum**: Solidity contract implementing hashlock/timelock with 1inch Fusion+ integration
- **Polkadot**: Substrate pallet with XCM for parachain routing and atomic swap completion

**Relayer System**
- **Event Monitor**: Watches both chains for swap initiations and completions
- **AI Router**: Analyzes user intent, fees, and yields to select optimal parachain
- **Resolver**: Handles partial fills, timeouts, and error recovery

**User Interface**
- **Swap Interface**: React app with real-time status updates via WebSocket
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Transaction history, success rates, and yield tracking
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for wallet and dApp integrations

## Technical Implementation

**Atomic Swaps**
```
1. User locks tokens on Ethereum with hash H and timelock T1
2. AI Router selects optimal parachain based on:
   - Current yields (Acala: 8% APY vs Moonbeam: 2% APY)
   - Transaction fees and speed
   - Token type and amount
3. Polkadot pallet locks equivalent tokens with same hash H, timelock T2 < T1
4. User reveals secret on Polkadot, claims tokens
5. Relayer uses revealed secret to unlock Ethereum tokens
```

**Parachain Intelligence**
- Real-time yield analysis across parachains
- Gas optimization for multi-hop transactions
- Failure recovery with automatic rerouting
